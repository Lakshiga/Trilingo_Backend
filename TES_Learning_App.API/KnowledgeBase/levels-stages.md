# Levels and Stages Management

## Hierarchy Structure
The Trilingo platform uses a hierarchical structure:
- **Language** → **Level** → **Stage** → **Activity**

## Levels
Levels represent different difficulty or progression stages:
- Level 1 is typically free
- Levels 2+ may require payment
- Each level belongs to a specific Language

### Managing Levels
1. Go to the Levels management page
2. Select a Language
3. Create, edit, or delete levels
4. Set level names in multiple languages (English, Tamil, Sinhala)

## Stages
Stages are sub-divisions within a Level:
- Each stage contains multiple activities
- Stages help organize content progression
- Stages also support multilingual names

### Managing Stages
1. Navigate to Stages management
2. Select a Level
3. Create stages with multilingual names
4. Organize activities within stages

## Best Practices
- Maintain consistent naming across languages
- Use clear, descriptive names for levels and stages
- Organize content logically (beginner → advanced)
- Test the progression flow before publishing
